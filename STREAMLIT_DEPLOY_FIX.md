# 🚨 STREAMLIT DEPLOYMENT FIX - URGENT

## ✅ Issues Fixed:

1. **Dependencies Updated**: Removed problematic packages that don't work on Streamlit Cloud
2. **Version Constraints**: Added proper version constraints to prevent conflicts
3. **Audio Dependencies**: Commented out audio-related packages (not supported on Streamlit Cloud)
4. **System Packages**: Simplified to only essential packages

## 🔑 IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:

### 1. Add Your API Keys to Streamlit Cloud

**🚨 THIS IS CRITICAL - Your app won't work without real API keys:**

1. Go to your Streamlit Cloud dashboard
2. Select your app
3. Click "Settings" → "Secrets"
4. Add this content with YOUR actual API key:

```toml
MISTRAL_API_KEY = "your_actual_mistral_api_key_here"
```

**Get Mistral API Key:**
- Go to: https://console.mistral.ai/
- Sign up/login
- Navigate to API Keys
- Create a new key
- Copy and paste it in Streamlit secrets

### 2. Verify Deployment Settings

**Main App File**: Make sure your Streamlit Cloud app is set to run `app.py` (not `orchestrator_streamlit.py`)

**Python Version**: Should be set to 3.11 (matches `runtime.txt`)

### 3. Expected Behavior After Fix

✅ **What should work:**
- Financial data queries
- Market analysis  
- Basic AI assistant features
- Plotly charts and visualizations

❌ **What won't work on Streamlit Cloud:**
- Voice/audio features (requires audio drivers)
- Local TTS (text-to-speech)
- Real-time audio processing

## 🔄 Deployment Steps:

1. **Commit these changes** to your repository
2. **Push to GitHub**
3. **Add API keys** to Streamlit Cloud secrets
4. **Restart your Streamlit Cloud app**

## 🐛 If Still Having Issues:

### Common Errors & Solutions:

**Error: "No module named 'orchestrator'"**
- Solution: Make sure `app.py` is set as main file

**Error: "MISTRAL_API_KEY not found"**  
- Solution: Add real API key to Streamlit Cloud secrets

**Error: "Package installation failed"**
- Solution: The updated `requirements.txt` should fix this

**Error: "Memory limit exceeded"**
- Solution: The smaller dependencies should help

## 📞 Quick Test:

After deployment, test with these queries:
- "What's the current price of AAPL?"
- "Analyze Tesla stock performance"
- "Show me market trends"

## 🔧 Alternative: Local Testing

To test locally while debugging deployment:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run locally  
streamlit run app.py
```
