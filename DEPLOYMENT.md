# Streamlit Deployment Guide

## Quick Summary of Changes

Your application has been successfully refactored to work without requiring external API services for Streamlit deployment.

### Key Changes Made:

1. **Fixed `st.set_page_config()` Error**: Moved page configuration to be the very first Streamlit command
2. **Removed API Dependencies**: Integrated orchestrator functions directly into Streamlit app
3. **Created Main Entry Point**: Added `app.py` as the main entry file for deployment
4. **Commented Out Problematic Dependencies**: Removed `openai-whisper` from requirements

## Deployment Instructions

### For Streamlit Cloud:

1. **Main App File**: Set your main file to `app.py` in Streamlit Cloud settings
2. **Requirements**: The app will use the current `requirements.txt` (with whisper commented out)
3. **Secrets**: Add your API keys to Streamlit secrets:
   ```toml
   MISTRAL_API_KEY = "NxdIH9V8xm8eldEGZrKvC1M1ziS1jHal"
   ```

### For Local Testing:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the app
streamlit run app.py
```

### File Structure:
```
├── app.py                          # Main entry point (USE THIS FOR DEPLOYMENT)
├── orchestrator/
│   ├── orchestrator_streamlit.py   # Main Streamlit app logic
│   └── orchestrator_fastapi.py     # Integrated orchestrator functions
├── agents/                         # All agent implementations
├── requirements.txt                # Dependencies (whisper commented out)
└── .streamlit/
    └── secrets.toml               # API keys configuration
```

## What Was Fixed:

### 1. Page Config Error
- **Problem**: `st.set_page_config()` was called after other Streamlit commands
- **Solution**: Moved it to be the very first command after imports

### 2. Import Dependency Issues  
- **Problem**: App tried to import orchestrator functions that required running services
- **Solution**: Integrated orchestrator functions directly into the Streamlit app

### 3. API Dependency
- **Problem**: App tried to connect to `localhost:8011` orchestrator service
- **Solution**: Removed external API calls and embedded functionality directly

### 4. Installation Issues
- **Problem**: `openai-whisper==20231117` had build errors
- **Solution**: Commented out the dependency (can be replaced with alternatives if needed)

## Current Status:

✅ **Ready for Deployment**: Your app should now deploy successfully on Streamlit Cloud
✅ **No External Dependencies**: App runs standalone without requiring separate services  
✅ **Page Config Fixed**: No more `st.set_page_config()` errors
✅ **Direct Function Calls**: Orchestrator functions integrated directly

## Testing:

Before deployment, test locally:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app should start without errors and provide the full AI Financial Assistant interface.
