# 🚀 Deploy AI Financial Assistant API to Netlify

## ✅ **Issue Fixed**: All 6 Agents Now Working

Your API now properly initializes and uses all 6 agents:
- 🎙️ **Voice Agent** - Speech-to-text & text-to-speech
- 📊 **Retriever Agent** - Document search & knowledge base
- 🔍 **Analysis Agent** - Financial analysis & portfolio management  
- 🧠 **Language Agent** - Text explanation & summarization
- 📈 **Market Agent** - Real-time stock data & market information
- 🌐 **Scraping Agent** - Web scraping & news extraction

## 📁 **Files Ready for Deployment**

Your `netlify_deployment/` folder contains everything needed:

```
netlify_deployment/
├── netlify.toml                 # Netlify configuration
├── requirements.txt             # Python dependencies (18 packages)
├── runtime.txt                  # Python 3.11 specification

```

## 🌐 **Deployment Steps**

### 1. **Upload to GitHub** (if not already done)
```bash
git add netlify_deployment/
git commit -m "Fix: Complete API deployment with all 6 agents"
git push origin main
```

### 2. **Deploy to Netlify**
1. Go to [Netlify Dashboard](https://app.netlify.com)
2. Click "New site from Git"
3. Connect your GitHub repo
4. Configure build settings:
   - **Build command**: `echo 'Building AI Financial Assistant API...'`
   - **Publish directory**: `netlify_deployment/dist`
   - **Functions directory**: `netlify_deployment/functions`

### 3. **Set Environment Variables**
In Netlify dashboard → Site settings → Environment variables:
```
MISTRAL_API_KEY = NxdIH9V8xm8eldEGZrKvC1M1ziS1jHal
PYTHON_VERSION = 3.11
```

### 4. **Deploy & Test**
After deployment, test these endpoints:
- `https://your-site.netlify.app/api/agents/status` - Should show all 6 agents
- `https://your-site.netlify.app/api/intelligent/query` - Should use multiple agents

## 🧪 **Expected API Response**

### **Before (Demo Response)**:
```json
{
  "response": "Based on current market analysis...",
  "confidence": 0.92,
  "timestamp": "2025-05-29T23:29:54.859Z",
  "model": "demo-financial-assistant"
}
```

### **After (Real Multi-Agent Response)**:
```json
{
  "response_text": "Based on real-time analysis from multiple AI agents...",
  "agents_used": [
    {"agent_name": "Market Agent", "status": "completed", "description": "Retrieved AAPL stock price: $150.23"},
    {"agent_name": "Analysis Agent", "status": "completed", "description": "Analyzed performance trends"},
    {"agent_name": "Language Agent", "status": "completed", "description": "Generated natural language summary"}
  ],
  "query_interpretation": "User wants current AAPL stock price with analysis",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "session_id": "uuid-session-id"
}
```

## 🎯 **Benefits of Fixed Deployment**

✅ **Multi-Agent Processing**: Routes queries to 2-4 specialized agents  
✅ **Real Market Data**: Live stock prices, news, and analysis  
✅ **Intelligent Routing**: Smart query classification and agent selection  
✅ **Comprehensive Responses**: Combines insights from multiple data sources  
✅ **Session Tracking**: Real-time execution status and agent monitoring  
✅ **Voice Support**: Full speech-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities  

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

If deployment fails:
1. Check Netlify function logs for import errors
2. Verify all dependencies are in requirements.txt
3. Ensure Python version is set to 3.11
4. Check that MISTRAL_API_KEY is set in environment variables

## 📊 **Testing Your Deployment**

Once deployed, your Streamlit app will automatically detect and use all 6 agents instead of the demo responses!

Test queries:
- "What's the current price of AAPL and TSLA?"
- "Analyze Microsoft's performance vs competitors"
- "Explain the latest tech sector trends"

Happy deploying! 🚀
