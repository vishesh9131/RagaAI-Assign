## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Session State Variables
```python
# Track previous audio to detect new recordings
if 'previous_audio_bytes' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.previous_audio_bytes = None

# Auto-submit preference
if 'auto_submit_enabled' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.auto_submit_enabled = True
```

### Auto-Detection Logic
```python
# Auto-submit functionality for recorded audio
if recorded_audio_bytes is not None and st.session_state.auto_submit_enabled:
    # Check if this is a new recording
    if (st.session_state.previous_audio_bytes is None or 
        st.session_state.previous_audio_bytes != recorded_audio_bytes):
        
        # Update state and auto-submit
        st.session_state.previous_audio_bytes = recorded_audio_bytes
        
        if not st.session_state.is_processing:
            send_intelligent_request(
                audio_file=recorded_audio_bytes, 
                voice_output_enabled=st.session_state.voice_output_enabled,
                show_debug=st.session_state.show_debug_enabled
            )
```

### Button State Management
```python
# Check if audio was auto-submitted
audio_auto_submitted = (recorded_audio_bytes is not None and 
                      st.session_state.auto_submit_enabled and 
                      st.session_state.previous_audio_bytes == recorded_audio_bytes)

# Update button appearance
if audio_auto_submitted:
    button_label = "🎤 Audio Submitted"
    button_type = "secondary"
    disabled = True
```
